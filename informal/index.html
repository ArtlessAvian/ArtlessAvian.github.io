            Hey, its my website. It's not exactly formal. Hopefully it's not as bad as previous iterations.
            It also doesn't work well on mobile.
            I'm working on getting rid of my life story, because eh.

            <h1>Summary</h1>
            <blockquote>
                I am a high school senior. I love programming and being obnoxiously "good" at competitive games.
                I have written and cloned some games, although they aren't polished. They're on my Github, and were written without much of an engine.
                I guess that's cool.
                <br>
                I am getting around to using the Godot Engine, and plan to make something sometime soon.

                <p> <!-- Thesis -->
                    My greatest strength and hobby is definitely programming.
                </p> <p>
                    I am completely self taught, with very little formal training.
                    Because of this, I have little sense of scale for what is (and isn't) advanced or impressive.
                    Take the upcoming bragging with a grain of salt.
                </p>
                <p>  <!-- Computer Science/Software Design Qualifications -->
                    In my opinion, I have moderate experience with algorithms.
                    (Time Complexity, Master Method, Designing Greedy Algorithms)
                    and data structures (Types, Usages, Associated Time Complexities).
                    I have some experience in software design (MVC, Observer Pattern, State Pattern), and am currently working to improve it.
                    I can work with APIs and frameworks, such as Java's LibGDX and Javacord.
                </p> <p> <!-- What I've done so far -->
                    I work in Java for a large majority of projects, using Intellij IDEA.
                    I am working on mastering computer science topics through Java first.
                    I have looked into webdev; this site is written by me, using Bootstrap, JQuery, and AngularJS.
                    I have dabbled with threading and full stack development.
                    Programming languages that I have used are BASIC, Logo, Pascal, Java, Python,
                    Javascript, OCaml, and Haskell.
                    I understand basic usage of Git.

                </p> <p>
                    Game development is a nice hobby, and a good way to learn programming in general.
                    I've been using it as a learning tool, and so I haven't made anything tangible. I did get close though.
                    I use LibGDX, and just started messing around in Godot.

                <h2>Non-Programming Interests</h2>
                <p>
                    I like to pretend that I am good at competitive video games.
                    I have passing interests in graphic design, drawing, piano, and music composition.
                    I can't say I am any good at any of them.
                </p>

                <hr>
                <h2>Personality</h2>
                <p>
                    I am a perfectionist, with the positive and negative qualities from it.
                    I like to think I am a good teacher.

                    I respect people who hyper-optimize their game play, pushing the limits of an engine or game.
                    It's cool to see a lot of effort pay off, in a way that's very obvious and visible.
                    Such things include speedrunning and competitive gaming.
