# Computer Science Undergrad Writing Games

<img style="float: right; width: 25%" src="assets/images/thats-me.jpg">
Hey! I'm Ryan Chang, a junior at UCI.
I'm majoring in Computer Science, specializing in Algorithms.
I'm also minoring in Mathematics.
I've been programming since before middle school,
with guidance from my brothers. The entire time,
I have been learning and writing games.

### Academics


### Game Development
In highschool, I began using LibGDX,
a "game development framework." This was when I
started my Github account, where many
repositories from that time still exist.

Currently, I'm using Godot and Unity.
For my time in college, I have been with the
Video Game Development Club at UCI, and
I am currently a programming officer at the club.

In my time away from classes and game development,
I regularly play Super Smash Bros. Melee.
To a lesser degree, I also play Tetris and Dungeon Crawl: Stone Soup.
