## Software Engineer, Interested in Algorithms
<!-- <img style="float: right; width: 25%; margin:20px" src="assets/images/thats-me.jpg"> -->

Hey! I'm Ryan Chang. I graduated from UCI, majoring in Computer Science, specializing in Algorithms.
I also minored in Mathematics.

<!-- I've been programming since before middle school,
with guidance from my brothers. The entire time,
I have been learning and writing games. -->

### Game Development
In highschool, I began using LibGDX,
a game development framework in Java. This around when I started my Github account;
many repositories of small games from that time still exist.
Now I'm using Godot and Unity. (I'm also trying my best to learn Unreal.)
Since I started college, I have been part of the Video Game Development Club at UCI.
I am currently the programming director at the club!

### More
In my time away from classes and game development, I'm up to a lot of shenanigans.

Every so often, I play a lot of Super Smash Bros. Melee. I've attended tournaments, though I don't place very well.
To a lesser degree, I also play the other Smash games and traditional fighting games.

(I also play a whole lot of other genres.
Recently, I've been into traditional roguelikes, like Dungeon Crawl: Stone Soup.)

I'm a big fan of speedrunning and especially enjoy runs that heavily involve glitches.
Its fun to learn to understand glitches in depth, and doing so usually hints at how the game was written.
Occassionally, some glitches involve hardware, like SRM in the N64 Zelda games.

I write stories for fun. I'm a little too self-conscious to show it to anyone (yet).
