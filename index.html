            Hey, its my website. It's not exactly formal. Iterations ago, it was, and it was stiff and cringy kinda.
            Hopefully this one isn't.

            <h2>Summary</h2>
            <blockquote>
                I am a highschool senior. I play a bit of Super Smash Bros. Melee and do some programming. I
                try to write and clone some games. I guess that's cool.

            <blockquote>
                I probably have a lot of hobbies and interests. At the moment I can't think of any.

            <h2>Super Smash Bros. Melee</h2>
            <blockquote>
                This clearly is important enough to be dedicated its own section. /s <br>
                For those unfamiliar with the game, you hit other people until they fly off the screen. It generally gets easier
                to do so as you hit them more.
                The game is pretty neat and it having a competitive scene is well deserved. Unfortunately I'm not too good
                at the game. I could be getting better but don't have time to throw around and don't have an ethernet cable to play online.
                You can find me getting last place along with 1/4 of other players at a high profile tournament.

            <blockquote>
                I used to know Pascal because of school. Now I don't, and prefer Java. I can pick up languages with the help of
                Google and StackOverflow quickly, but don't because I'd prefer to learn more about algorithms, data structures, and software design principles.

            <h2>Game Development</h2>
            <blockquote>
                Game development is a nice hobby, and a good way to learn programming in general.
                I've been using it as a learning tool, and so I haven't made anything tangible. I did get close though.
                I use LibGDX, and just started messing around in Godot.
