I write games in Godot and Unity.
Here are some notable things I have worked on.

        <p>
        A falling blocks puzzle game in Godot. This was written by me. 
        </p> <p>
        As is, it is an exact clone of the SNES game Tetris Attack.
        I wanted to declone the game, but ran into time issues
        the quarter I pitched the game to VGDC@UCI.
        </p> <p>
        I want to continue working on this.

        <p>
        An action adventure platformer game in Unity.
        I was a programmer, acting as a bit of a tech lead.
        </p> <p>
        I experimented making my own physics for the player controller.
        I built the camera system and a hitbox collision system.
        </p> <p>
        Our team decided not to submit our game to itch.io.

        <p>
        A turn based strategy game in Unity.
        I was a programmer, volunteering to work on systems.
        </p> <p>
        I implemented pathfinding for a directional move system with weighted tiles.
        I built a system to draw paths.
        I designed a camera that can be smoothly panned both by player controls and by code.
