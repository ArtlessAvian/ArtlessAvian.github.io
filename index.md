Hello! I'm Ryan. I love algorithms, math, and games.
I graduated from UC Irvine in 2022, with a major in Computer Science (Algorithms specialization) and a minor in Math.
It's really useful for problem solving, which lets me make impressive (or silly) projects.
<!-- I can reduce problems to other problems with known algorithms, even if not obviously linked.
From studying them, I can usually recreate the proof of their correctness or speed, and consequently DIY an implementation without rote memorization.
The math side is less formally trained, but I've looked into game theory and done some recreational math. -->
On the applied side, I currently work as a Software Engineer. In my free time, I create games.
In my personal projects, I care a lot about software archtecture, since its what usually limits the size of projects for me.
<!-- I'm always improving on balancing between keeping things flexible and not overcomplicating things,
but that balance is always changing as my standards change.
Sometimes, complex systems are just complex and can't be abstracted away, and understanding them and their representation
can be as interesting to me as algorithms.  -->

Below, I have a few of the games (and game related projects) I've made, with descriptions, links, images, and commentary!
