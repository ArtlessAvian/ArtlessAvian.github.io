I write games in Godot and Unity.
Here are some notable things I have worked on.

## [Overload](https://artlessavian.itch.io/overload-super-unfinished)
A falling blocks puzzle game.

As is, it is an exact clone of the game Tetris Attack.
I wanted to declone the game, but ran into issues
the quarter I pitched the game to VGDC@UCI.

I might continue working on this.

## [Rogue Synthesis](https://johantan.itch.io/rogue-synthesis)
A turn based strategy game by VGDC@UCI.

I implemented pathfinding for a directional move system with weighted tiles.
I designed a system to draw paths.
I wrote code to pan the camera through player controls and through code.
