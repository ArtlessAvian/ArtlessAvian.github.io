            I respect people who hyper-optimize their game play, pushing the limits of an engine or game.
            It's cool to see a lot of effort pay off, in a way that's very obvious and visible.
            Such things include speedrunning and competitive gaming.
        </p> <p>
        I don't speedrun myself. I do play through games with good movement and corner cutting, but not to the level of speedrunning.
        However, I've been consistently drawn to competitive games. Like many people, I haven't reached a level anywhere near perfection,
        but the effort is still satisfying.

        <h2>Super Smash Bros. Melee</h2>
        <p>
            The game is neat and it having a competitive scene is well deserved. Unfortunately I'm not too good
            at the game. I could be getting better but don't have time to throw around and don't have an ethernet cable to play online.
            You can find me getting last place along with 1/4 of other players at a high profile tournament
            <a href="https://smash.gg/tournament/genesis-3/events/melee-singles/brackets/2618/15750">here.</a>
        </p> <p>
        I've had the game since forever, but I picked up the game in around freshman year. I knew there was a competitive scene,
        but I didn't play with intent to compete, but to explore. This was because I picked Yoshi randomly, and accidentally discovered
        Double Jump Canceling, which was pretty cool. This random choice is why I still play Yoshi, although he is not a perfect character.
        I found my neighbor also played, and my brother set me up to fight him. I was destroyed, if I recall correctly.
        This started my foray into competition.
    </p> <p>
        I'd like to say I'm good at the game, but I can't really say much for results. I don't blame my character.
        I get stomped by people at my school who play. I go slightly less than even with my brother. It all comes down to experience,
        and I don't get much playing the AI. Here's hoping I get better in college.
    </p> <p>
        These lists are probably missing things. As of now (rusty), I can consistently:
        <ul>
            <li>Wavedash imperfectly</li>
            <li>SHFFL</li>
            <li>Waveland on platforms well</li>
            <li>Edgedash</li>
            <li>DJC Aerials</li>
            <li>DJC Movement Shenanigans</li>
            <li>Edgehog with Eggthrow, Dash Attack, Double Jump Turnaround</li>
            <li>Moonwalk</li>
            <li>Platform Circle (useless)</li>
        </ul>

        I can inconsistently
        <ul>
            <li>Throw Eggs (Mildly Accurate)</li>
            <li>Perform Edge Canceled Eggs (too risky)</li>
            <li>L Cancel (Rusty)</li>
            <li>Platform Cancel Uair (2 frame trick)</li>
        </ul>

        I cannot
        <ul>
            <li>Parry</li>
            <li>Play Neutral :(</li>
        </ul>

        In 20XX Barrel Buster, I break 100 barrels on average.

        <h2>Tetris (and Puyo Puyo)</h2>
        <p>
            I really didn't go into Tetris expecting competitive gameplay, but it emerged somehow. In 2017, I saw a
            <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/smashbros/comments/781fbw">reddit post</a>
            (in /r/smashbros actually) about Tetris. It was pretty informative and even had a meme video (boom tetris for jeff).
            I didn't think much about it until I was bored in class with a Chromebook. I ended up doing a lot of sprints in jstris,
            the best Tetris fan client. Discovering more depth other than speed, I learned most spins for all the pieces offhandedly.
            I also roped my friend group and my brother into Tetris somehow.
        </p> <p>
        I also grew interested in Puyo Puyo due to Puyo Puyo Tetris videos. I think it was this game that drew my friends and brother.
    </p> <p>
        Here are some (poor) measurements of skill.
        I have a 3.5k elo in Puyo Puyo Tetris, playing Swap and Versus (Tetris).
        I have an <a href="https://jstris.jezevec10.com/replay/316147">89 second 40-Line Sprint</a>, with obvious mistakes other than hesitation.
        I can do most spins for all pieces, amd I can t-spin double and triple freehandedly.
        I have serviceable finesse with fast DAS.

        I have done an 8 chain in single player Puyo.

        Not impressive, but also still enough to be better than most people.
    </p> <p>
        (Shoutouts to Harddrop and Puyo Nexus, from this random person)
