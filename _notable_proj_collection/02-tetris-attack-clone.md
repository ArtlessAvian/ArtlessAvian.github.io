I learned a hard lesson on contribution ettiqute. Communication and comments go a long way.

My brothers and I are big fans of Tetris Attack and its many iterations. As a puzzle game, it is surprisingly competitive,
with a fairly high skill ceiling.

One of my brothers started writing a clone in Javascript + HTML, and invited me to help. He had already been pretty far in, and had something playable.
So, I was pretty enthusiastic to contribute. So, I just dumped in a feature just because I could.
