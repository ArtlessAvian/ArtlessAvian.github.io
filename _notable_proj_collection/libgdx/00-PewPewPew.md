My first project was small, lasting two days. Drawing sprites is an important first step, I guess.

I was familiar with Java, and I had a small graphics library that my book provided.
I wrote something like this project, but it wasn't amazing. I wanted something stronger.
I looked at LWJGL, but then settled on LibGDX, because it made sense faster.
The game is pretty ok.
