This was a small two day project. I was familiar with Java, and I had a small graphics library
that my book provided. I wrote something like this, but it wasn't amazing. I wanted something stronger.

I looked at LWJGL, but then settled on LibGDX, because it made sense faster.
The game is pretty ok.
