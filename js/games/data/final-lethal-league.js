       "First, many thanks to the group members, Ryan P. Tran and Ryan L. Tran. Together, we built a clone of Lethal League, " +
       "a non-traditional fighter. I would consider it the most complete project I have made as of now (July 2017). " +
       "I hope that the others have learned much from working with the codebase, which in my opinion is structured decently. " +
       "There is still room for improvement, and I might poke around and refurbish it.",

       "When I heard that the final project would be of our choice, I knew I wanted to do a game. I didn't know what game to make, " +
       "or who to team with. Also, they would have to pick up LibGDX or I would have to make a facade, using our limited time. " +
       "Ryan, Ryan, and I (Ryan) teamed up again (from the project school-blackjack) and decided to write Lethal League, " +
       "which I had been playing too much in class.",

//        "There were several pitfalls which slowed projects. The most harmful was school computers and their inflexibility. " +
//        "The classroom had desktops with the bare necessities. They would delete local files on logout. " +
//        "Installing other programs is restricted, and only BlueJ was installed for students to use for their IDE." +
//        "While I understand it is used because it is consistent and inflexible, friendly to beginners, and lightweight, I feel those features " +
//        "stopped being useful early on in the class. It would not work with libraries, and would only work well with its own file structure. " +
//        "Working in a group mostly meant crowding around a computer with one person doing the heavy lifting. " +
//        "I used Sublime Text 3 instead, placed in my student drive. While not as strong as an IDE, it was better for me. " +
//        "However, the network was not reliable. The network would repeatedly go down, removing access to project files " +
//        "and also Sublime Text for me. All this was remedied by just bringing my laptop to school, which is what I normally use anyways.",
//
//        "The next issue was the learning curve for others. The other two weren't familiar with how to write a game, " +
//        "how to use LibGDX, and how to use Github. Because no engine is provided, we tried to cobble together an engine, " +
//        "without autoimport and suggestions. This meant that they were floundering around with Javadocs, wasting time unnecessarily.
//        "The project barely built on my computer. I only knew how to open CMD (bypassing restrictions) by accident, " +
//        "trying to make a build script with ST3, and I had to learn to use Gradle. " +
//        "Then, we tried to work together using Github's web client, which was awkward to work with. They had not much experience," +
//        "and made mistakes. This could have been avoided if we used the desktop client (which I still use instead of the command line), " +
//        "but there can't be any persisting files on the school computers.",

       "At first, we failed to make an engine on school computers. We were using plain java objects, without much structure in mind. " +
       "After being tired of the poor code quality, we agreed that I could trash the code.",
       // look at the commit log u fool
       "(I should write outlines for these instead of jumping in.)"
