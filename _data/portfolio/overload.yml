  Overload is a falling blocks puzzle game in Godot.
  This was a prototype I worked on by myself to pitch to VGDC@UCI. 

  For code, this game's design avoids excessive objects,
  an issue with
  <a href="https://github.com/kc34/tetris-attack-clone">an earlier project</a>
  I did with my brother many years before this project.
  There, the board is represented as a 2D array of block objects.
  Each block object was stateful.

  Rather than have every block be an object, I kept it simple.
  The board is represented by a jagged array of integers.
  The number of extra objects is kept minimal.
  For example, an entire column of falling blocks would be one object.
  This approach was perfect for this game,
  and it even allowed me to create unit tests and to apply test-driven development.

  As is, it is an exact clone of the SNES game Tetris Attack.
