  Antsylvania is an action adventure platformer game in Unity.
  I was a programmer, acting as a bit of a tech lead.
  
  I experimented with making custom physics for the player controller.
  I built the camera system and a hitbox collision system.
  
  Unfortunately, our team decided not to submit our game to itch.io.
