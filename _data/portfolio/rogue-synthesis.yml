  Rogue Synthesis is a turn based strategy game in Unity.
  I was a programmer, volunteering to work on systems.
  
  * I implemented pathfinding for a directional move system with weighted tiles.
  * I built a system to draw paths.
  * I designed a camera that can be smoothly panned both by player controls and by code.
