  "VGC Collapse" is a team building assistant running entirely in the browser.
  It was created as a hackathon project!
  I was the backend programmer, working on the algorithms and interfacing with the front end.

  * I learned TypeScript in a weekend, so I could make a webapp while still taking advantage of static typing.
  * I learned and implemented an arc consistency algorithm.
  * I coordinated with my team to connect my logic to the frontend.

  Funny enough, I was not too familiar with constraint satisfacation.
  The game-dev world knows of it as "wavefunction collapse," and I knew of it from there instead.
