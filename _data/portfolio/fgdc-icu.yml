  FGDC is a fighting game featuring original characters from the Video Game Development Club at UCI.
  It's the last project I made with the club before graduating, so I went all out.

  The game also features rollback netcode!
  A library handled the networking, but relied on its users (us, the developers) to serialize inputs and hash the state.
  It worked well! Something I wish was within scope was some sort of automated testing to detect regressions.
  After a desync issue was caught though, `git bisect` would usually be enough to find the cause.
  
  The main goal was keeping scope managable, with lots of room for stretch goals.
  There's only two buttons, meaning six normals (standing, crouching, jumping) and two variants for each command.
  This was enough for lots of design work, with no filler moves.
  The animation emphasizes key poses. We wanted a paper aesthetic (a "paper prototype"), which lets us use those poses
  and imply movement with flipping and spinning.
  Under these constraints, we hit a lot of stretch goals, making four unique characters.

  The "final" build is a little rough but has everything it needs for local play.
  I planned to fix up loose ends wiht the project after graduating.
  But I started working and got busy. Dang.
  I'd still do it if I found a nice opportunity to.
