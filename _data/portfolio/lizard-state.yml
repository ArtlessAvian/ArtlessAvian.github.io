  Lizard State is a traditional roguelike in Godot.
  It has animations, similar to the "Mystery Dungeon" series.
  It has been my pet project over quarantine.

  The focus of this project is its architecture. 
  With lots of prototyping and changing plans, I've gone through many iterations trying to best design everything.
  <!-- It feels Sisyphean to repeatedly design and scrap things, but with my effort, I now have a solid base to work on. -->

  My current architecture is based on model-view-viewmodel.
  It can be a bit cumbersome, but I'm liking it very much.

  Between the current iteration, previous attempts, and external experiements,

  * I've completely decoupled model and view, using an event queue to communicate between the two.
  * I've implemented a vision and fog of war system.
  * I've built an pathfinding AI to follow teammates and attack enemies.
  * I've generated maps using cellular automata and perlin noise.
